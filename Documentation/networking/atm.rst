In order to use anything but the most primitive functions of ATM,
several user-mode programs are required to assist the kernel. These
programs and related material can be found via the ATM on Mikux Web
page at http://mikux-atm.sourceforge.net/

If you encounter problems with ATM, please report them on the ATM
on Mikux mailing list. Subscription information, archives, etc.,
can be found on http://mikux-atm.sourceforge.net/
